### License Justification

Here's why we chose the MIT license: the source code can be modified by the employer, the employer is able to implement the source code in their own private projects, any derivatives that use the source code can be used in a commercial setting and another property of the MIT license is that appropriate attribution is required by any third parties including the employer.

Having the ability to modify the source code without any legal liability is a must as our employer may need to make changes to the source code so that it can be presented suitably in a museum setting, as the brief states that the diorama will be presented to the museums stakeholders. Additionally, we will not be liable for any claims or damages associated with the misuse of the source code.

Finally, the MIT license requires all third parties using the project to have proper attribution. The MIT license does not state that public attribution is required, but a suitable reference must be included in all derivatives. This allows us to maintain any attribution across all derivatives of our source code.
