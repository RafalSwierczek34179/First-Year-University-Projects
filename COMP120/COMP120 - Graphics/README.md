THE IMAGE IS LOADED MANUALLY, CHANGE FILE DIRECTORY ON LINES 23 AND 24 FOR THE SOLUTION TO WORK


Requirements:

Allow the user to load any image from their files.

The user should be able to press a button which applies multiple effects to the image to make it look like it has been drawn. (As close to manga/anime style as possible)

The user should be able to press a button to save their new image to any location on their pc.



Potential Algorithms I could use:

Colour Distance, Colour Tolerance, Edge-Detection, Luminance, and Posterization.



License Justification:

I have chosen the MIT license because I want to keep the project open source. I don't mind other people copying, modifying, distributing, or sublicensing my work into their own more proprietary work, whether commercial or private. If someone finds a way to improve my project and wants to make it closed source then that's fine, I still see that as benefitting the community because I personally won't be updating this work past my assignment submission. All uses of my work will have to include copyright and license notices, crediting me as the original author of the source code, however I will not be held liable for any claims, damages or other liabilities that are connected to my project.
