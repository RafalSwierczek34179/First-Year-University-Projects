This is the folder for your Unity Project

How to Play:
The goal of Gravitate is to find a way out of the caves, along the way the player will stumble across dead ends and a bunch of different enemies. To defeat enemies the player must knock into them as quickly as possible(at least 6m/s) to do damage, otherwise the enemies will damage the player. There are 3 types of enemies, generic red enemies that are 1 hit kill and will follow the player around until they're out of range, purple slime enemies which are just bigger red generic enemies with more health but upon death they release a bunch of smaller and quicker versions of themselves (pretty much minecraft slimes), and light blue gun enemies which wont damage you upon contact but will definately shoot you,the bullets are slow and dont doo much damage but they push you back a decent amount so the closer you are to a gun enemy the harder it is to hit them with enough speed. Good Luck and Have Fun! 

p.s. it's possible to escape without killing the enemies at all though it may be hard
